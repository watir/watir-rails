# Watir::Rails

This gem adds the [Watir](http://github.com/watir/watir) usage support when writing integration tests in Rails.

## Installation

Add this code to your Gemfile:

````ruby
group :test do
  gem 'watir-rails'
end
````

## Usage

Just use Watir like you've always done in your requests/integration tests:

````ruby
browser = Watir::Browser.new
browser.goto home_path
browser.text_field(name: "first").set "Jarmo"
browser.text_field(name: "last").set  "Pertman"
browser.button(name: "sign_in").click
````

### Ignore exceptions

By default, exceptions raised by Rails application will be re-raised in your tests.

Please, note that it only happens if `config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions` is set to `false` in `config/environments/test.rb` (or any other environment you use it tests). If it is set to `true`, watir-rails will automatically disable exception catcher.

You can tell watir-rails to ignore exceptions:

```ruby
Watir::Rails.ignore_exceptions = false
```

## Limitations

* Watir-Rails works currently only with the [Watir-WebDriver](http://github.com/watir/watir-webdriver) and not with
the [Watir-Classic](http://github.com/watir/watir-classic) due to the problems of running a server
in the separate thread when WIN32OLE is used.
The problem is probably caused by the fact that [WIN32OLE overwrites Thread#initialize](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/test/ruby/test_thread.rb#L607).

* When using Rails path/url helpers in your tests then always use path instead of url methods, because latter won't work!
